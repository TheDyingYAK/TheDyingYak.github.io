Welcome. I’m TheDyingYak, a cybersecurity professional specializing in red teaming. This blog serves as a platform to explore the technical, strategic, and often unpredictable aspects of cybersecurity from an adversarial perspective.

With a focus on red teaming, I work at the intersection of offense and defense, simulating real-world threats to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen organizational security. My aim is to share insights into methodologies, tools, and lessons learned from years of testing the resilience of systems against sophisticated attacks.

This blog isn’t about sugar-coating the challenges of cybersecurity; it’s about presenting a clear-eyed view of the landscape. Whether you're a fellow practitioner, someone transitioning into cybersecurity, or simply curious about how adversaries think, you'll find content here that aims to inform and provoke deeper discussions.

When I’m not immersed in analyzing threat vectors or crafting attack scenarios, I’m likely reading or playing games on my desktop. My approach to cybersecurity is rooted in realism: threats evolve, and so must our defenses.

I welcome questions, feedback, and conversations. Together, let’s explore the critical role of red teaming in securing our increasingly digital world.
